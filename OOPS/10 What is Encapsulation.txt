Q. What is Encapsulation?


- Have you ever seen capsule use for medication, it is made up of two components- first
  is the medicine itself and second is the outer layer which is use to protect medicines
  from various factors like cold and hot environment etc. So important medicine is 
  wrapped into some container called capsule which is used to protect medicines from 
  outer contact.

  Similarly, variables and function are wrapped into class and object. You can consider
  class as outer container that protects variables and function from any outside 
  unauthorised access.

  So, Wrapping a variables and function into single unit like a class is called as 
  Encapsulation.
  
  Use - Restricting access to variables and function
        Data hiding (abstraction)
