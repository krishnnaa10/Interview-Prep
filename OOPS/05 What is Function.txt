Q. What is Function?


- Functions are small piece of codes performing a particular task.

       The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly tasks done together to
  make a function so that instead of writing the code again and again for different 
  inputs, we can call this function.

  In simple words, A function is a block of code that runs only when it is called.
