Q. What is method overriding?


- Method overriding is a feature that allows us to have multiple functions with the
  same name but in different classes that is in parent and child class.

  ie... RBI Class (Parent class)
        int rateofintrest(){
          print("7%");
        }

        SBI Class (Child class)
        int rateofintrest(){
          print("6%");
        }

  Method overriding is also called as Function overriding.
