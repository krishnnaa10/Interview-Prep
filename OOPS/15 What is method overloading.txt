Q. What is method overloading?


- Method overloading means having two or more methods (or functions) in a class with the 
  same name and different parameters.

  ie... function add(int a, int b){
           return a+b;
        }

        function add(int a, int b, int c){
           return a+b+c;
        }

  and compiler decides which function to call based on parameters at compile time.

  It is also known as Function Overloading.
