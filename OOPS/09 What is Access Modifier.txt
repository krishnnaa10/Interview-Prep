Q. What is Access Modifier?


- Access modifiers (or access specifiers) are keywords that control the accessibility of classes,
  methods, and other members.

   Types : Public , Protected, Private, Default

     Public - Information that we want to share with every other class declared as public.
     ie.. My degree 

     Protected - Information that we want to share only with the child classes will be declared 
     as protected.
     ie.. How much money i have (only share with my child) 

     Private - Information that we don't want to share with anyone will be declared as private.
     ie.. How much girlfriends i had in past

     Default - Information that we want to share with every other class in the same package will
     be declared as default. If we don't use any access specifier then it will be consider as 
     default.
     ie.. Where is the duplicate key of the house (share with the members of the house)
