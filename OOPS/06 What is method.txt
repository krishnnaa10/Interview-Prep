Q. What is method?


- A method is an action which an object is able to perform.

  Classes can also contain functions called methods that are available only to objects of 
  that type. These functions are defined within the class and perform some action helpful
  to that specific object type.

  For example, Car class may have a repaint method that changes the color attribute of our car.

  ie.. Class Car
       Object MyCar

       color = red
       repaint()     <-- This is method
