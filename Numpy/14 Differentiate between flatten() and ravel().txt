Q. Differentiate between flatten() and ravel().


There are two kinds of methods to convert a ndarray into a 1D array : flatten() & ravel().

     With the key difference being that is flatten() creates a new copy of the array and new array
do not affect the original array while ravel() returns a view of the array and changes made to the 
new array may affect the original array.
