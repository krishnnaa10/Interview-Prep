Q. Can you tell me how do you handle tight deadline situations?


- I believe teamwork, communication, planning, time management are keys in these situations.

       When i will face with tight deadlines of high pressure situations, i will prioritize
  my tasks, create a detailed plan, & break down the work into manageable chunks.
