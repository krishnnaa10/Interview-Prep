Q. How much you rate yourself in scale of 1 to 10?


- I would rate myself 8 out of 10 because I have a strong foundation in my skills, and I have 
  worked on multiple projects in data analysis. 

             However, I believe thereâ€™s always room for improvement, and I continuously learn 
  new things to enhance my expertise.
