Q. Would you lie for the company?


- What I have learned from life is that a lie cannot remain hidden for long. So, I will always try to 
  find a solution to a problem rather than lying. 

            Misleading someone might bring short-term benefits, but in the long run, it can harm both 
  the company and my professionalÂ integrity.
