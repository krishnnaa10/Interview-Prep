Q. If you face any conflict in your workspace, how will you handle it?


- When conflict or disagreement arises, i believe in addressing them openly and respectfully and
  deal with conflict as soon as possible rather than take it off.

            I will actively listen to different perspectives of people involved  in that conflict
  to understand their concern. Communication is the key to handle the conflict so i communicate 
  respectfully and maturely.
