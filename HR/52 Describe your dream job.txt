Q. Describe your dream job.


- My dream job is one where I can use my skills to make a positive impact, learn new
  things, and grow in my career. I want to work in a supportive environment where I 
  feel valued for the work I do.

        Ideally, it would be a job where I wake up excited to go to work each day.
