Q. How do you deal with criticism?


- If someone provides me with constructive criticism i am always open for it. i will 
  work on correcting myself & learn from my mistakes. No one is perfect so it's important
  to learn form our mistakes.

              but, if the feedback is negative then i am mature enough to ignore it. the 
  most important thing is not to let criticism get myself down or discourage from pursuing
  my goals.
