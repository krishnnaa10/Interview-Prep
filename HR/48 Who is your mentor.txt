Q. Who is your mentor ?


- IN SEARCH of the genuine meaning of a mentor, I couldn’t find anything more fitting to
  describe the special person simply as my ‘best friend’. 

               We have friends for about 12 years now. He was one who guided me to study
  Engineering. I have always looked upon to him because i have a huge respect for him.
