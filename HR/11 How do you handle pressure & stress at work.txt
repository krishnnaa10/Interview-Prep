Q. How do you handle pressure & stress at work?


- I am naturally calm and highly organized, so I am rarely stressed. I prioritize tasks 
  efficiently and break down complex problems into manageable steps. 

           When I feel stressed, I take short breaks and practice deep breathing to help
  me recharge, maintain productivity, and stay composed under pressure.
