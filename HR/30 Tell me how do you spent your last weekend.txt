Q. Tell me how do you spent your last weekend ?


- I spent my last weekend like a typical day, nothing special. I started by checking my emails 
  and organizing my tasks for the day. I made a to-do list and focused on completing each task 
  one by one. Overall, it was a productive and calm weekend.
