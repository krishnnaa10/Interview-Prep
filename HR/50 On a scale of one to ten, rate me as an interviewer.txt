Q. On a scale of 1 to 10, rate me as an interviewer?


- Thank you for giving me such an opportunity, but for sure I'm not in the position to rate you
  as an interviewer. 

           Anyway, I'm not going to disappoint you. I can give you 10 out of 10, But I'll give 
  you 9/10 as there should always be a scope to increase our skills which will create an interest
  in learning new things.
