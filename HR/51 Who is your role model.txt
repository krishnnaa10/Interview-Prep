Q. Who is your role model?


- I am inspired by many people, especially Ratan Tata, Sushant Singh Rajput, and MS Dhoni. I am
  always trying to adapt the good qualities of these individuals.

            From Ratan Tata, I admire his kindness and helping nature. I have learned to always be
  ambitious and plan for the future from Sushant, and I aim to stay calm and make smart decisions, 
  even in tough situations, like MS Dhoni.
