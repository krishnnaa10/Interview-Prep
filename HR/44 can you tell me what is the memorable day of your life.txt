Q. can you tell me what is the memorable day of your life ?


- Life is full of memories, events, moments and experiences. Everyone has a special memory
  personally as well as professionally that they will never forget.

       The most memorable day of my life was from my personal life. it was when i saved
  a person's life. It was very special and proud feeling for me as a human being. I never 
  forget it was 10th day of Durga Puja which is Dussehra in 2018.
