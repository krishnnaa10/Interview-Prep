Q. Can you tell me something about your family?


- I belong to a small family of 5 members including me. My grandfather is the head of my
  family and he is a priest and my mother is a home maker.

         I am the eldest son in my family. I have one brother and one sister. My sister 
  is Preparing for NEET examination and my brother is in 11th standard. 

                 We all support each other in every way.
