Q. Do you like to work alone or in a team?


- I enjoy working by myself and as a team pretty equally. I'm adaptable and can adjust
  my work style to fit the situation.

           but, When i have to complete something on my own, when i have to concentrate
  on my work then i like to sit alone and increase my productivity.
