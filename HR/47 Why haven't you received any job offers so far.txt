Q. Why haven't you received any job offers so far?


- I have received a couple of offers, but I didn’t join because the roles didn’t align with my skills
  and career goals. Nowadays, many companies prefer face-to-face interviews, and unfortunately, I have
  missed more than 15 to 20 interviews due to this. 

               However, I have been actively applying, improving my skills, and working on projects to 
  enhance my expertise and stay prepared for the right opportunity.
