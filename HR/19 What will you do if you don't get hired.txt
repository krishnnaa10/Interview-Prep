Q. What will you do if you don't get hired?


- I fully trust that the committee will choose someone who will be the perfect 
  fit for the position. If i don't get hired, I'll wait for constructive feedback 
  and use it to improve myself for the next opportunities.

        However, i still think i am the one you are looking for.
