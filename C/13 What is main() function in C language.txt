Q. What is main() function in C language ?


- The main function is an integral part of the programming languages such as C, C++, 
  and Java.
 
         The main function in C is the entry point of a program where the execution of a
  program starts. It is a user-defined function that is mandatory for the execution of a
  program because when a C program is executed, the operating system starts executing the
  statements in the main() function.
