Q. Explain Dynamic memory allocation.


- Dynamic Memory Allocation(DMA) allows us to allocate memory at run time.

          Generally variable allocates the memory at compile time, for example int a; here, 'a' will 
  allocate memory at compile time. But in case of Dynamic Memory Allocation, memory allocates at run 
  time. In C language, there are a lot of library functions (malloc, calloc, or realloc,..) which are
  used to allocate memory dynamically.
