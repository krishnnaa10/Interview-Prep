Q. Why C is a General-Purpose Language ?


- General purpose is a term used in the developer world when a particular code, program,
  or software is meant to offer general functionalities instead of specialized ones. Such
  software or programs are capable to handle a variety of tasks, so they attract more 
  users and are mostly available at low cost.

          Programming languages like C, C++, Python, JAVA, C#, Ruby, Dart all are General
  Purpose language.
