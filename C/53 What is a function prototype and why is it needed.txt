Q. What is a function prototype and why is it needed?


- A function prototype is a declaration of a function that tells the compiler about the function's
  name, return type, and parameters. 

            It is needed because C is a strongly-typed language and the compiler needs to know the 
  types of the arguments and return value in order to generate correct code. Without a function 
  prototype, the compiler would have to guess at the function's signature, which could lead to errors
  or undefined behavior.
