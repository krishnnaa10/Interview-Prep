Q. Define do while loop.


- The do while loop works very similar to while loop. This loop will execute the code
  at least once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop
  as long as the condition is true.

  ie.. do {
         printf(i);
         i++;
       }
       while(i<5);
