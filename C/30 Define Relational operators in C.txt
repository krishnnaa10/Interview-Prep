Q. Define Relational operators in C ?


- Relational operators check the relationship between two of the available operands. In
  case the relation happens to be true, then it returns to 1. But in case this relation
  turns out to be false, then it returns to the value 0.

  Relational operators are also called as Comparison operators.

  ie.. == , != , > , < , >= , <=
