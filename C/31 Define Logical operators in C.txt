Q. Define Logical operators in C.


- In C programming, logical operators are used to evaluate the truth value of an 
  expression or a condition. They allow programmers to combine multiple conditions
  and test them simultaneously.

  There are three logical operators in C:

  "&&" (logical AND), "||" (logical OR), and "!" (logical NOT).
