Q. What is the major disadvantage in C language ?


- C is a massive and vast language, but it does not have the concept of OOPs like
  Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Data Hiding, overloading,
  and overriding. Due to this it is sometimes hectic for the programmer to solve a
  real-world problem easily.
