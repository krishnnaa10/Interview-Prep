Q. Define function.


- Functions are small piece of codes performing a particular task.

       The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks done together to
  make a function so that instead of writing the code again and again for different 
  inputs, we can call this function.

  In simple words, A function is a block of code that runs only when it is called.

  ie...  void myFunction() {
            printf("I just got executed!");
         }

         int main() {
            myFunction();
            return 0;
         }
