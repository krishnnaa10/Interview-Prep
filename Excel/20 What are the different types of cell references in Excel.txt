Q. What are the different types of cell references in Excel?


- Excel has three types of cell references:

   1. Relative Reference (A1) – Changes when copied to another cell.
   2. Absolute Reference ($A$1) – Remains fixed when copied.
   3. Mixed Reference ($A1 or A$1) – Either row or column stays fixed.
