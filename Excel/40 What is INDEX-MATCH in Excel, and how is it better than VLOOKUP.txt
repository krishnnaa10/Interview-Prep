Q. What is INDEX-MATCH in Excel, and how is it better than VLOOKUP?


- INDEX and MATCH functions are the perfect duo for advanced data lookup and retrieval.

  INDEX-MATCH combines two functions:  

    MATCH - Finds the position of a value in a range.  
    INDEX - Returns the value from that position in a table.

  It is better than VLOOKUP because :

    Can search in any direction (left or right).
    Faster for large data.
    No need to count columns.
