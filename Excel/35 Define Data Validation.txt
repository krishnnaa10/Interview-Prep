Q. Define Data Validation.


- Data validation in Excel refers to setting specific criteria for accepting data in a cell
  or range of cells. This feature prevents users from entering invalid data that could lead
  to errors in calculations. It ensures data accuracy.

  Example -

  - Ensure emails have "@â€œ.
  - Dates follow DD-MM-YYYY.
  - Age should be between 18 and 65. 
  - Prices shouldn't be negative.
  - No two employees should have the same ID.
  - Phone number contains only 10 values.
