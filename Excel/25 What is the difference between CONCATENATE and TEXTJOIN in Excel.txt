Q. What is the difference between CONCATENATE and TEXTJOIN in Excel?


- CONCATENATE (or CONCAT in newer versions) joins multiple text values but does not allow a
  delimiter between them.
  Syntax - CONCATENATE(text1, [text2], ...)

  TEXTJOIN allows a delimiter (such as a comma or space) and can ignore empty cells.
  Syntax - TEXTJOIN(delimiter, ignore_empty, text1, [text2], ...)
