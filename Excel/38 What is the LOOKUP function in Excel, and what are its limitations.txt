Q. What is the LOOKUP function in Excel, and what are its limitations?


- The LOOKUP function in Excel searches for a value in a row or column and returns a corresponding
  value from another row or column. 

  It has two forms: 

  Vector Form - LOOKUP(lookup_value, lookup_vector, result_vector)
  Array Form - LOOKUP(lookup_value, array)

  Limitations :

  -> Only Works with Sorted Data (Ascending Order).
  ->  Only returns the closest match if an exact match isn't found.
  -> Can't search from right to left.
  -> Not available in newer Excel versions (Replaced by VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP & XLOOKUP)
