Q. Define XLOOKUP.


- The XLOOKUP function in Excel is a powerful and flexible tool designed to replace older lookup
  functions like VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP. Unlike these traditional functions, XLOOKUP can search both
  vertically and horizontally, making it ideal for retrieving specific values from any range in a
  table.
 
       XLOOKUP makes data retrieval in Excel easier and more reliable.

  =XLOOKUP(lookup_value, lookup_array, return_array, [if_not_found], [match_mode], [search_mode])

  XLOOKUP is available in Excel 365 and Excel 2019 (and later versions). It is not available in older
  versions like Excel 2016, 2013, or 2010.
