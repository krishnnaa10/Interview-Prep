Q. Define Shallow copy.


A shallow copy in Pandas creates a new DataFrame object that references the same underlying data as the
original DataFrame. This means that any changes made to one DataFrame will also reflect in the other.

                It is like two people sharing the same book. If one person writes something in the book,
the other person will also see the change.
