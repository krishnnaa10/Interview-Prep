Q. What is the difference between WHERE clause and HAVING clause ?


- The WHERE clause filters individual rows before grouping, while the HAVING clause filters 
  groups after aggregating data, with the key difference being that WHERE cannot be used with 
  aggregate functions, whereas HAVING can.
